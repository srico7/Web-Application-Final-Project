            <h3>World Environment Day 2021: 75% Of Emerging Infectious Diseases Are Zoonotic, Caused By Biodiversity Loss, Warns UNEP</h3>
            <p> According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the issue of zoonotic diseases or zoonoses which are the illnesses that can be passed on from animals to humans is emerging as an issue of global concern. 
                UNEP stressed that zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19, Ebola, Swine Flu, Lyme disease among others are interlinked with the health of ecosystems. The degradation of the environment and the loss of biodiversity caused by 
                indiscriminate human actions may result in frequent pandemics like the ongoing COVID-19 in the coming years.

            <h3>5 Lesser-Known Companies Pursuing Sustainable Innovation to Check Out This Earth Day</h3>
            <p>Earth Day is a great opportunity to reflect on ways the global economy can move forward without inflicting further harm on 
               our planet. In a year that saw a global pandemic and raging wildfires juxtaposed against record stock markets, 
               it is often the largest companies that have gotten the most attention around ambitious sustainability goals.

            <h3>UNEP Publications Assess Status of Environmental Targets</h3>
            <p>A publication by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) assesses 92 environmental indicators of the SDG framework, 
               finding that 67% “follow a positive trend” while 33% show little change or are trending negatively.
               On a more positive note, another assessment, the 2020 ‘Protected Planet Report,’ announces the expected achievement of 
               a 2020 global target on protected or conserved land, corresponding to SDG target 15.1.

            <h3>Well-being stable despite coronavirus, but nature under pressure</h3>
            <p>The year 2020 was defined by the coronavirus pandemic. Covid-19 is confirmed to have claimed 17.4 thousand lives in the Netherlands last year,
               and another 2.7 thousand deaths had covid-19 as probable cause of death. The economy took an enormous hit and consumption plummeted. For the first time in years, satisfaction with life decreased. 
               In spite of all this, well-being increased in a number of areas: people were more satisfied with their jobs and with how much free time they had, and their trust in institutions showed a strong increase.

            <p>Progress on protecting life on land has been agonisingly slow, as deforestation and habitat loss has accelerated,

            <h3>Boosting Education for Greener Forests</h3>
            <p>With every new forest fire or flood, and with every new report on the loss of wildlife or increase in desertification, 
               we are reminded that we urgently need greater attention and efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the world’s forests. 
               Fewer natural disasters, a more stable climate, healthier people, and stronger economies are just some of the benefits that we stand to gain from helping forests to thrive. But do we know enough about the world’s forests to take care of them properly?
               There is growing international concern over the quality and availability of training and education needed both to prepare those whose daily work and decisions most closely impact the sustainable management of forests, and to inform new generations who will look after forest resources in the future.</p>

            <h3>SDGs provide direction for sustainable post-COVID recovery</h3>
            <p>The novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) has brought a smidge of immediate relief in 
               selected areas related to Sustainable Development Goal 15 to protect ‘Life on Land’. 
               While lowered biodiversity safeguards could erode India’s progress on the goal
               the targets can offer direction for post-COVID-19 recovery and development, said experts.
               Amid the pandemic, a Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) report said COVID-19 impacts on SDG 15 are “still unclear”, 
               but observed a short-term reduction in threats to terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity due to reduced global economic activity and consumption.
