                <h3>OURE SELF</h3>We are first year students at NSBM Green University.We created this web site as the final assignment of our lesson unit on Web Application Development.<br><br>

                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>Habitat loss due to deforestation or any other depletion Fresh water quality deterioration Soil erosion Increases land degradation and carbon emissions into the atmosphere In short, non-action on forests affects the health
                of the planet as well as our community.<br><br>So there are problems with land life Projects like ours aim to promote sustainable forest management, stop deforestation, significantly increase global deforestation and deforestation, as
                well as repair degraded forests. Ensuring sustainable use and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.
                <br><br>
                <h3>SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT</h3>The primary objective of the web site is to detect the current problems and find solutions to overcome with sustainable environment. SDG 15 looks for the upkeep of existence on land and priorities which is established
                through international conventions and agreements.<br><br>The natural forest area loss and biodiversity decline as opposed to the restrained sources is a massive area that we target to answer. We inspire conservation and improvement specialists
                to have interaction with the ones answerable for all of the agenda 2030 objectives to make certain that Life on Land is a concern in all SDG associated processes. So basically, we are going to build a platform to discuss, share and to
                get certain information about SDG 15 Life on Land for anyone that are interested in.<br><br>
